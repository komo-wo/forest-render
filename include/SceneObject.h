 * @brief An object placed in a scene to be rendered. 
 * To be honest, this class is poorly designed. Most of the public fields should
 * be private, and access to them should only be through class methods. But we are
 * building graphics demos, not large-scale projects, so we'll opt to make everything
 * public which reduces the amount of code we have to write.
